# Introduction

_"Get off my LAN, Grandpa"_

* -- Any Generation Z kid born in the new millennium with WIFI.

Before Macromedia's [Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash)
became ubiquitous back in 1985
[Br√∏derbund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broderbund)
released a fantastic animation program called `Fantavision`

* ![Box Front](pics/fantavision_box_front.jpg)

The box has definitely seen better days:

* ![Box Back](pics/fantavision_box_back.jpg)

You gotta love the marketing people. They couldn't even:

* Keep the aspect ratio correct
* Had to use a MOCKUP for the screen !

Here is a picture with an _actual_ screenshot with the correct aspect ratio:

* ![Box Back Aspect Ratio](pics/fantavision_box_back_aspectratio.jpg)

## Karateka!?

Speaking of the back of the box, what-the-heck is a picture of **Karateka** doing there???

* ![Back Box Zoom](pics/fantavision_box_back_karateka.png)

This background is from Karateka

* ![Kareteka Logo](pics/karateka.png)

At least the manual cover is pretty cool!

* ![Manual Cover](pics/fantavision_manual_cover.jpg)

OK, now that I'm done obsessing over "the goods" let's get back on topic.

_Fantavision_ had a "mouse cursor" and pull-down menus on the Apple II back in 1985 all
in glorious 6 color 280x192 resolution.

* ![Logo](pics/about.png)

But isn't there more then 6 colors in that picture?
Technically, no, but dithering gives the impression there are more colors.

It is a pity it was never updated to use the Double Hi-Resolution graphics
that the //e (enhanced), //c, and Laser 128 supported. (YES, I'm aware there was a IIgs version.)

Back then I had many unanswered questions about it:

* Where is the Logo stored on disk?
* Where are the (bitmap) icons stored in memory?
* How is the (mouse) cursor drawing code done?
* What is the movie file format?
* How is it copy-protected?
* How could we remove the copy-protection?
* How does the backup utlity know if a copy has been made?

Let's have some fun exploring these. Along the way we'll discover:

* Boot Tracing
* Learn HOW Fantavision is actually copy-protected
* Restore the "Backup Functionality" by writing an "UNBACKUP" program
* Use COPYA to copy it so we can inspect it with any Sector Editor
  * Trivially crack it
* Easter Eggs

Let's get started!


# Preparation

Before we get started, first a word from our sponsor, er, experience.

**WARNING:** _ALWAYS_ write-protect your **original disk** to prevent (accidental) mistakes from happening!

No, _I've_ never done that, but it is WAY too easy to make this mistake.
Take the 30 seconds (of insurance). You won't regret the peace of mind it will bring.

With that warning out of the way:

Let's create a blank DOS 3.3 data disk that we'll use to save our work-in-progress.

1. Boot your favorite "Fast" DOS such as ProntoDOS or Diversi-DOS.

2. Replace the disk with a blank floppy.

3. Enter these lines:

```
    NEW
    10 ?CHR$(4);"CATALOG"
    INIT HELLO
```

4. Remove it from the disk drive and label it as `Fanta.Work`



# ESC to Bug Out

You may or may not know that while Fantavision boots up
one can hold `ESC` down to enter the built-in backup utility!

Sadly, most originals will show this screen:

* ![Backup used](pics/backup_used.png)

What we want is this picture:

* ![Backup available](pics/backup_available.png)

Now my //e has 3 disk drives, two connected on Slot 6, and one on Slot 5.
For fun let's boot Fantavision from drive 5 and enter the backup utility.

We get the message:

```
Make sure that the Fantavision disk is in slot 5, drive 1
```

OK.

Pressing `RETURN` and it reboots from slot 6.  Whoops!
The programmer detected which slot it was started from but were lazy
and didn't properly "exit" (JMP) to the right slot.

If we were really bored we could write some boot sector tools
on the blank disk in slot 6 and "chain" reverse engineering
but let's take the more traditional approach.

# Ye Olde Boot Tracing

1. If you computer isn't already on, turn it on and press `CTRL-RESET`

2. Insert the original Fantavision disk in Slot 6, Drive 1

3. Type these instructions:

```
    CALL-151
    9600<C600.C6FFM
    96FA:1F
    1F01:00
    9600G
```

We end up with this "error" screen:

```
1F03-    A=01 X=60 Y=00 P=31 S=F0
*
```

<hr>

NOTE: Laser 128

If you are on a Laser 128 or 128 EX system the 9600G trick _won't_ work.
You'll need to add these commands / patches as well:

```
    C600:0
    9800<C800.C8FFM
    960D:98
    9610:98
    9660:98
    9669:98
    9696:96
    96D7:98
    96EA:98
```

<hr>



Let's turn off that drive motor so we don't wear the drive (and disk) out.

```
    C0E8:1
```

Technically you don't need to _store_ any thing at the Drive Motor IO location.
Even a read will trigger turning off the drive motor:

```
    C0E8
```

We want to save this puppy so let's move the Boot Stage 1 to a safe place ...

```
    3800<800.8FFM
```

... and reboot with our `Fanta.Work` disk so we can save it.

I already have a work ProntoDOS disk in Drive 5 so I'll be using ...

```
    C500G
```

... but if you only have 1 drive you'll just need to flip disks more often.
Anytime you see `C500G` replace it with:

```
    C600G
```

Once we are back in DOS land we can save it.

```
    800<3800.38FFM
    BSAVE B1.FANTAVISION_T00S0_0800,A$800,L$100
```

Now that we have the boot sector saved let's tear into it and see what it is doing.
Now I could be a jerk and hand-wave it as

* _"Implementation Details"_ or the equally annoying
* _"Left as an Exercise for the Reader"_

but I'll be nice guy and provide a fully documented disassembly:

## P5 Boot PROM

The boot sector contains code to:

* `Seek a Track`, and
* `Read a Track`.

Who knew we would already have 75% of `RWTS` -- Read, Write, Track, Sector :-)

In case you are wondering where `Sector` comes from --
it comes from the P5 PROM ReadSector routine @ $C65C.
On my //e it looks this:

# Boot Tracing Stage 1b

Since we'll be typing in the same commands over and over again
let's make a "Turn-Key" system on our DOS data disk.

```asm
    1EEE:A2 00      LDX #$00
    1EF0:BD 00 C6   LDA $C600,X
    1EF3:9D 00 96   STA $9600,X
    1EF6:E8         INX
    1EF7:D0 F7      BNE $1EF0
    1EF9:A9 1F      LDA #$1F    ; Stop @ $1F01
    1EFB:8D FA 96   STA $96FA
    1EFE:4C 00 96   JMP $9600
    1F01:00         BRK
```

That is,

```asm
    CALL-151
    1EEE:A2 00 BD 00 C6 9D 00 96
    1EF6:E8 D0 F7 A9 1F 8D FA 96
    1EFE:4C 00 96 00
```

Save it via:

```
    BSAVE BOOT.STOP,A$1EEE,L$14
```

And let's make it auto-load when we boot our DOS disk:

```
    LOAD HELLO
    5 ? CHR$(4);"BLOAD BOOT.STOP"
    SAVE HELLO
```

However, we need to stop after boot stage 2 has loaded:

```asm
    1F01:A9 0E      LDA #$0E
    1F03:8D 7F 08   STA $087F   ; 87E: JMP $BE00
    1F06:A9 1F      LDA #$1F    ;  ->
    1F08:8D 80 08   STA $0880   ; 87E: JMP $1F0E
    1F0B:4C 01 08   JMP $0801
    1F0E:00
```

```
    1EEEG
    C0E8:1
    4000<B000.BFFFM
```

Boot to our `Fanta.Work` disk ...

```
    C500G
```

... so we can save it:

```
    BSAVE B2.FANTAVISION_T15_B000,A$4000,L$800
```

We'll also want to save Boot Stage 3 while we're here to use later:

```
    BSAVE B3.FANTAVISION_T22_BC00,A$4C00,L$400
```

    B568:60         RTS
```

This first nibble check reads these disk nibbles on Track $22:

    F5 F4 CF
    [4&4 x256] [4&4 x256]
    D5
    [4&4 x256] [4&4 x256]
    D5
    [4&4 x256] [4&4 x256]
    D5
    [4&4 x256] [4&4 x256]
    D5

This is one of the reasons you need a "Bit-Copier" to copy Track $22.
There are no sectors as traditionally defined by `D5 AA 96` and `D5 AA ED`!

There are many different ways to remove the protection.
The simpliest is to format track $22 normally,
and modify $B500 to load them in. See [Kracking](#Kracking-Fantavision)

That is exactly what Black Bag's "Kracked" version of Fantavision does.

## Stupid Kids and their Graffiti

* ![Black Bag Krack](pics/logo_blackbag.png)

Really? You had to deface the logo?!

No, I'm NOT talking about the "Names", but _these_ changes:

* the `S` in Software
* the `f` in Software
* Adding stray pixels?

For comparision here is the original logo:

* ![Logo](pics/logo.png)

Here is a "difference" between the Original and Black Bag logos:

* ![Black Bag Difference](pics/logo_difference_blackbag.png)

At least they fixed the grammar, right? `Br0derbund presents`

What were talkin about? Oh yeah, the specifics of the Black Bag crack.

On Track $15, Sector $5 @ $B500 it uses:

* RWTS_ReadPrologue = $B126 and
* RWTS_ReadSector   = $B011

to read two sectors on a normal formatted track $22.
_That_ code looks like this:

```asm
                    ReadBoot3:
    B500:A9 22          LDA #$22                ; Nibble Check Track been converted to normal sector
    B502:20 09 B0       JSR RWTS_Seek           ;
    B505:A2 60          LDX #$60                ; BUG! Hard-Coded to Drive in Slot 6 !
                    FindSector0:                ; Should be: LDX rwts_SlotX16 -> LDX $FD
    B507:20 26 B1       JSR RWTS_Prologue       ;
    B50A:A5 E3          LDA rwts_Sector_Have    ;
    B50C:C9 00          CMP #$00                ; Logical Sector $0 -> Physical Sector $0
    B50E:D0 F7          BNE FindSector0         ;
    B510:85 E6          STA rwts_LoadAddr       ; Double Duty
    B512:A9 BE          LDA #$BE                ; Dest Addr = $BE00
    B514:85 E7          STA rwts_LoadAddr+1     ;
    B516:20 11 B0       JSR RWTS_ReadSector     ;
                    FindSectorD:                ;
    B519:20 26 B1       JSR RWTS_Prologue       ;
    B51C:A5 E3          LDA rwts_Sector_Have    ;
    B51E:C9 0D          CMP #$0D                ; Logical Sector $1 -> Physical Sector $D
    B520:D0 F7          BNE FindSectorD         ;
    B522:E6 E7          INC rwts_LoadAddr+1     ; DestAddr += $0100
    B522:20 11 B0       JSR RWTS_ReadSector     ;
    B527:18             CLC                     ; Signal $087C Nibble Check = PASS
    B528:60             RTS                     ;
```

Looks like this was an amateur rush job

* if you try to boot this version in Slot 5 it will fail.
* They waste an entire Track for 2 sectors
* This "loader" code is bloated taking 41 bytes compared to 19 bytes needed
  to do the job. We'll cover this in _Cracking Step 1: The Easy Stuff_


Someone even patched the backup utility !

We will discuss this more when we remove the copy protection ourselves.

    BF09:D0 F7              BNE _CountKey
    BF0B:E0 A0              CPX #$A0        ; Keep reading until we have 160 keys
    BF0D:90 A8              BCC _Nib0       ;^ $BEB7
    BF0F:60                 RTS

                        NibRead:
    BF10:BD 8C C0           LDA DriveData,X
    BF13:10 FB              BPL NibRead
    BF15:60                 RTS
```

What this code is doing is checking for $A0 = 160 keys on disk of the form:

```
    D4 D5 DE A5  ?? ??  E5 AA   ?? ?? ??
    \_________/  \___/  \___/   \______/
     Prologue    KeyYY  Epilog  Random Sync Bytes
```

Recall that bytes in 4&4 format are stored as disk nibbles:

|Hex| 4&4 |
|:-:|:---:|
|$00|AA AA|
|$01|AA AB|
|...| ... |
|$D5|EA FF|


The rest of the code is pretty straightforward.

```asm
                    Verify64K:
    BF16:2C 83 C0           BIT $C083

# Time to go LOCO, er LOGO

## Logo -- no, not the language

1. Boot our `Fanta.Work` disk

2. Enter in this short ML (machine language program)

    1F31:4C 48 08           JMP $0848
```

Via:

```asm

    1F09:20 01 08

    1F2D:D0 F6 A6 2B 4C 48 08
```

* Note: That A and Y are swapped comprared to RWTS_ReadTrack at $B000

3. And save it:

```
    BSAVE GET_LOGO_1,A$1EEE,L$46
```

4. Replace Slot 6, Drive 1 disk with the original Fantavision.
And now for the moment of truth ...

```asm
    1EEEG
    C050 C052 C054 C057
```

5. When you are done viewing ...

```asm
    C051
```

## Logo Take 2

For some unknown reason there is actually a complete _second_ copy of the logo on disk!?

```
    BLOAD GET_LOGO_1
    CALL-151
    1F0D:A
    1F14:B
    BSAVE GET_LOGO_2,A$1EEE,L$46
```

* ![logo 2](pics/logo_2.png)

Hmm, why is our logo messed up??

It turns out there are 4 tracks that are mirrored !?!?!?

|Track| Description                 |
|:---:|:---------------------------:|
| $08 | Mirror of Track $1A, unused |
| $09 | Mirror of Track $19, unused |
| $0A | Mirror of Track $18 @ $3000 |
| $0B | Mirror of Track $17 @ $2000 |

This is easy enough to fix, we just need to swap the track load order. :-)

Boot our `Fanta.Work` disk ...

```
    BLOAD GET_LOGO_2
    CALL-151
    1F0D:B
    1F14:A
    BSAVE GET_LOGO_2,A$1EEE,L$46
```

You know the drill ... replace Slot 6, Drive 1 with Fantavision,
and `1EEEG`

* ![logo](pics/logo.png)


## Logo Take 3 !

Track $20, Sectors $8 .. $F has yet a _3rd_ copy of the logo! (Bottom 1/4)

```
    BLOAD GET_LOGO_2
    CALL-151
    1F0D:20
    1F14:21
    BSAVE GET_LOGO_34,A$1EEE,L$46
```

* ![logo 3](pics/logos_34.png)

If we compare the original logo on Tracks $17 and $18 to this third copy
we find:

* Track $20, Sector $8 == Track $18, Sector $8 @ $3800


## Logo Take 4 !!

And just when you thought it couldn't get any more loopy ...
Track $21, Sectors $8 ..$F has yet a _4th_ copy of the logo! (Bottom 1/4)

If we compare the original logo on Tracks $17 and $18 we see that:

* Track $21, Sector $8 == Track $18, Sector $8

Are you going loco yet?

In case you are curious how does Fantavision orignally loads the logo?
That resides at $BE89:

```asm
    BE89:AD 52 C0       LDA $C052
    BE8C:AD 57 C0       LDA $C057
    BE8F:AD 50 C0       LDA $C050

    BE92:A9 17          LDA #$17        ; Track $17
    BE94:20 09 B0       JSR RWTS_Seek

    BE97:A9 20          LDA #$20        ; Load $2000 .. $2FFF
    BE99:A0 17          LDY #$17        ; First half of logo on track $17
    BE9B:20 00 B0       JSR RTWS_LoadTrack

    BE9E:A9 30          LDA #$20        ; Load $3000 .. $3FFF
    BEA0:A0 18          LDY #$18        ; Second half of logo on track $18
    BEA2:20 00 B0       JSR RTWS_LoadTrack
```

Here is a easy way to view these:

# Boot Tracing Stage 4


# "What this, 'Byte-Code', you say young chap?" Harrumph.

Long before Java popularized the concept of byte-code in
[1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history)
people were already using the concept _at least_ **9 years earlier**
back in 1985!

* [Zork I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork)
is probably the most famous program to use byte-code -- back in 1980 -- predating
even Fantavisio by 5 years.

  * The [Z-Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-machine) was created in 1979.

* [UCSD Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCSD_Pascal) is probably the second most famous example -- back in 1978 !

  * [P-Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-code_machine) first appeared in 1966 !

Who knew that it would take almost 30 years for byte-code to go mainstream!


## Backup Take 1

Track $20 has the built-in Backup Utility which is loaded in at $0800.

How do I know that?

* $B500 decodes Track $22 in 4&4 format to $BC00 .. $BFFF
* $BE00 has the relevent code that loads it:

```asm
                        Main.Backup = $0800

                        KEYBOARD    = $C000
                        KEYSTROBE   = $C010

                        ORG $BE00

BE00:4C 06 BE           JMP $BE06

BE06:20 16 BF   JSR Verify64K

BE5A:AD 00 C0           LDA KEYBOARD        ; Key pressed?
BE5D:C9 9B              CMP #$1B + $80      ; ESC pressed?
BE5F:F0 07              BEQ LoadBackup      ;v $BE68

                LoadBackup:
BE68:2C 10 C0           BIT KEYSTROBE
BE6B:A0 20              LDY #$20            ; Y = Track
BE6D:A9 08              LDA #>Main.Backup   ; A = Address
BE6F:20 00 B0           JSR RWTS_LoadTrack
BE72:4C 00 08           JMP Main.Backup
```

## Backup Take 2

However on Track $21 there is yet _another_ copy of the Backup Utility !

Let's write some code to load both of them. :)

1. `PR#5` to boot our `Fanta.Work` Disk
2. `BLOAD GET_LOGO_1`
3. `CALL-151`

```asm
    1F0D:20
    1F14:21
    BSAVE GET_BACKUP_T20_T21,A$1EEE,L$46
```

4. Replace your Fantavision disk in slot 6
5. `1EEEG` to boot Fantavision
6. Replace your Fanta-work disk in slot 5
7. `C500G` to boot Fanta-work
8. `CALL-151`
9. `800<2000.27FFM`
10. `BSAVE B5.BACKUP_T20_0800,A$800,L$800`
11. `800<3000.37FFM`
12. `BSAVE B5.BACKUP_T21_0800,A$800,L$800`
13. `BSAVE LOGO_3_T20,A$2800,L$800`
14. `BSAVE LOGO_4_T21,A$3800,L$800`


## Backup Byte-Code Interpreter

Both backup versions share the same Byte-Code design,
but Track $21 has an extra 2 bytes in the interpretor
which causes the Array of Function Pointers to start
at a higher location in memory.

We are interested in the table of function pointers.

|Track|Func Ptr|
|:---:|:-------|
| $20 | $0845  |
| $21 | $1047  |

Comparing the two jump tables:

|Token| $20 | $21 |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| $00 |$0885|$1087|
| $01 |$FB35|$FB35|
| $02 |$FC57|$FC57|
| $03 |$088E|$1090|

| $11 |$08D6|$10D8|
| $12 |$08EC|$10EE|
| $13 |$0901|$1106|

We find they are identical (barring the +2 offset.)

Let's decode the byte code tokens:

```
    0845 FunctionJumpTable
    0845: [$00] CMD_DONE  $0886 Return to caller, like 6502: $00 BRK

To 'fake' the `backup used` we can enter in this patch:

```asm
    BD1:A9
    BD3:EA

    800G
```

Sure enough we get this backup used screen:

* ![Backup used](pics/backup_used.png)

And just for kicks, let's use an original version that already _has_ been
backed up.

```asm
    9600<C600.C6FFM
    96FA:
```

Here is a disassembly of the first few bytes of the Applesoft program.

Let's pivot that table to make it easier to read:

## Applesoft Tokens

In case your knowledge of Applesoft is rusty,
Bit-7 is used to desiginate BASIC "Tokens"

Quick review of Applesoft in ROM on the Apple.

* $D000 is an Array of 16-bit Function Pointers
* $D0D0 is the string (in DCI format) of all the token names.

Let's write a program to generate a nice table for us:

```asm
    ORG $300
    LDA #$D0    ; 0300:A9 D0
    STA $FE     ; 0302:85 FE
    STA $FF     ; 0304:85 FF
    LDA #$80    ; 0306:A9 80 Start @ Token $80
    STA $FC     ; 0308:85 FC

^0  JSR PRBYTE  ; 030A:20 DA FD
    LDA #$A0    ; 030D:A9 A0 space char
    JSR COUT    ; 030F:20 ED FD
^1  LDY #$00    ; 0312:A0 00
    LDA ($FE),Y ; 0314:B1 FE
    PHA         ; 0316:48
    INC $FE     ; 0317:E6 FE
    BNE ^2      ; 0319:D0 02
    INC $FF     ; 031B:E6 FF
^2  ORA #$80    ; 031D:09 80
    JSR COUT    ; 031F:20 ED FD
    PLA         ; 0322:68
    BPL ^1      ; 0323:10 ED
    JSR CROUT   ; 0325:20 8E FD   CROUT = $FD8E

    LDA $C000   ; 0328:AD 00 C0
    BPL ^4      ; 032B:10 0B
    STA $C010   ; 032D:8D 10 C0
^3
    LDA $C000   ; 0330:AD 00 C0
    BPL ^3      ; 0333:10 FB
    STA $C010   ; 0335:8D 10 C0
^4
    INC $FC     ; 0338:E6 FC
    LDA $FC     ; 033A:A5 FC Token
    CMP #$EB    ; 033C:C9 EB
    BNE ^0      ; 033E:D0 CA
    RTS         ; 0340:60
```

Enter in the raw machine code:

```
    300:A9 D0 85 FE 85 FF A9 80
    308:85 FC 20 DA FD A9 A0 20
    310:ED FD A0 00 B1 FE 48 E6
    318:FE D0 02 E6 FF 09 80 20
    320:ED FD 68 10 ED 20 8E FD
    328:AD 00 C0 10 0B 8D 10 C0
    330:AD 00 C0 10 FB 8D 10 C0
    338:E6 FC A5 FC C9 EB D0 CA
    340:60
```

Which generates this table:

## Boot Stage Memory Map

From the Boot Sector and Boot Stage 2 @ $BE27 we can build this disk -> memory map

| $16 | $0800 .. $17FF |

# Disk Information

If one boots up Copy \]\[ 5.0 and uses the `Sector Editor`
to read the original `Fantavision` disk you'll get an `I/O Error.`

Inspecting the disk nibbles via `Copy > Bit Copy > Nibble Editor`
Tracks $00 through $21 we find the following disk nibbles
for Track $00, Sector $0:

```
D5 AA 96 FF FE AA AA AA AA FF FE DE AB
\______/ \___/ \___/ \___/ \___/ \___/
 Address  Vol   Trk   Sec   XOR  Address
Prologue  254   $00   $0   Check Epilogue

...random sync bytes...

D5 AA AD ...342... DE AA EB
\______/           \______/
 Data               Data
Prologue           Epilogue
```

The standard Address bit-stream for a DOS 3.3 disk is:

```
D5 AA 96 vv vv tt tt ss ss cc cc DE AA EB
\______/ \___/ \___/ \___/ \___/ \______/
 Address Vol.  Track Sec.  Check Address
Prologue                         Epilogue
```

Everything looks kosher with _Fantavision_ -- except
the changed Epilog disk nibbles from the
standard `DE AA EB` to the non-standard `DE AB`!

Returning to the Sector Editor we can press `P` to patch DOS 3.3
and use `RETURN` to cycle through the fields until we get to
`CHECK EPILOG?`, `N` to toggle it, then `ESC` to return to the sector edit.

```

AH-HA!  Success!

Q. Why does the P5 PROM read these sectors but not DOS or ProDOS ?

A. We're getting ahead of ourselvs but the P5 PROM:

* **only** checks the 3 disk nibbles od the Prolog fields, and
* _ignores_ the Epilog fields entirely!



## COPY, eh?

To over-use a cliche, _"With knowledge comes power."_

With our new found knowledge we can use the old standby `COPYA` on a
DOS 3.3 Master (disk) to copy all but the last track.

The only catch are:

* we need to tell DOS 3.3 to ignore the Address Prologue (or use the correct one), and
* we need to tell COPYA to skip track $22.

Both of these are pretty easy to do:

DOS 3.3 only checks for the disk nibble `$DE` epilog in one of two places:

* Address Epilog at $B98B
* Data Epilog at $B92F

The Data fields are read in DOS 3.3's function `READ16` @ $B8DC but we are
only interested in the Data Epilog portion @ $B92F:

```asm
    392F:BD 8C C0       155 READ7       LDA Q6L,X
    3932:10 FB          156             BPL READ7       *** NO PAGE CROSS! ***
    3934:C9 DE          157             CMP #$DE        FIRST BIT SLIP MARK?
    3936:D0 0A          158             BNE RDERR       (ERR IF NOT)
    3938:EA             159             NOP             DELAY BETWEEN NIBLS.
    3939:BD 8C C0       160 READ8       LDA Q6L,X
    393C:10 FB          161             BPL READ8       *** NO PAGE CROSS! ***
    393E:C9 AA          162             CMP #$AA        SECOND BIT SLIP MARK?
    3940:F0 5C          163             BEQ RDEXIT      (DONE IF IT IS)
    3942:38             164 RDERR       SEC             INDICATE 'ERROR EXIT'.
    3943:60             165             RTS             FROM READ16 OR RDADR16.
```

The Address fields are read in DOS 3.3's function `RDADR16` @ $B944 but we are
only interested in the Address Epilog portions @ $ B98B:

```asm
398B:BD 8C C0       093 RDA6        LDA Q6L,X       FIRST BIT-SLIP NIBL.
398E:10 FB          094             BPL RDA6        *** NO PAGE CROSS! ***
3990:C9 DE          095             CMP #$DE
3992:D0 AE          096             BNE RDERR       ERROR IF NONMATCH.
3994:EA             097             NOP             DELAY BETWEEN NIBLS.
3995:BD 8C C0       098 RDA7        LDA Q6L,X       SECOND BIT-SLIP NIBL.
3998:10 FB          099             BPL RDA7        *** NO PAGE CROSS! ***
399A:C9 AA          100             CMP #$AA
399C:D0 A4          101             BNE RDERR       ERROR IF NONMATCH.
399E:18             102 RDEXIT      CLC             CLEAR CARRY ON
399F:60             103             RTS             NORMAL READ EXITS.
```

We need to change byte @ $B99B from $AA to $AB.

Technically we only need to change one of these.

1. Boot a DOS 3.3 Master disk
2. `LOAD COPYA`
3. Make these changes to the Applesoft program

```
166 B=169:GOSUB 400:B=0:GOSUB 400`
167 ET=34
168 POKE 721,ET:POKE 722,ET:POKE 863,ET
400 POKE 47514,B:POKE 47422,B:RETURN
401 REM $B99A:C9 AA
402 REM $B93E:C9 AA
```

4. Grab a blank disk, label it `Fanta.COPYA`
5. Put your original `Fantavision` disk in Drive 1
6. Put your blank `Fanta.COPYA` disk in Drive 2
7. `RUN`

It will boot but fail to load due to missing the encrypted track $22.
Let's fire up `Copy ][` Sector Editor and make the _modifications_
to skip reading track 22.


## Kracking Fantavision

Back in the day all the kids pretending to be cool used to use "3l33t" (elite) speak.
The altenative spelling of "cracked" -- kracked -- is simply part of this "culture"
or "warez scene" as it was (self) called.

"Cracking", or Kracking -- however the heck you want to spell it,
is the (fine) art of removing copy protection.  When you shell out $40 for a program
you expect to be able to make a backup.  Disks get damaged, companies go out
of business, and basically you, the customer, is screwed up shit-creek without a paddle.
This is unacceptable.

Of course some us, *cough*, also have _other_ reasons:

* To learn,
* Because we can,
* The fastest way to motive a programmer is to tell them they _can't_ do something!

_"Bet you can't copy this disk?"_

_"Oh yeah? Let's see about that!"_

Before the word _hacking_ got hijacked to mean _destructive intrusion_,
hacking _originally_ meant a **benign curiosity.** HOW did something work?
Learning for the sake of learning was the goal.

And then the script kiddies and "black hats" wrecked it for everyone.
People who started "trading" software without any moral considerations for
respecting other people's property -- since the justification was:

* Software is just a number afterall ...

The problem is the original publishers didn't get their money.
Next thing you know "hacking" is a "bad" thing.  Yeah, FUCK OFF MSM (main-stream media)!
I'm still bitter about this corruption of words for some "agenda."

The original "hacker culture" had an ethos or "Code of Conduct."
You NEVER did anything out of malice.  Inspite of pubslishers treating
you like crap and assuming you were one of those dirty "pirates."

And thus the copy protection wars were started.

Both sides not trusting the other -- and basically wanting to screw them over.

Enough about the history lesson.

How can we bypass the two nibble counts used on the original disk?

* ![Disk](pics/fantavision_disk.jpg)

Recall that Boot Stage 2 at $B500, reads in the 4&4 encypted Boot Stage 3
into $BC00 .. $BFFF. The code at $BC00 .. $BD26 is used by the Backup Utility
to write out $BE00 .. $BF00 onto track $22.  Since our disk is normal
DOS3.3 / ProDOS format we don't care about these two pages $BC and $BD.
The only relevent code is $BE00 .. $BF5F

Now it seems silly to waste an entire track $22 just for two sectors worth of data
at $BE00 .. $BFFF. It turns out when we analyzed the `RWTS` that there
were two unused pages:

| Track | Sector | Address |
|:-----:|:------:|:-------:|
| $15   | $6     |  $B600  |
| $15   | $7     |  $B700  |

We can store the decoded $BE00 .. $BFFF @ $B600, have the boot sector move
them "up" in memory to their final (original) destination @ $BE00, by-pass
the second Nibble Count and Bob's our uncle.

We have a choice of where to put the memory mover:

* At $08E0 .. $08FF, the unused padding of the boot sector, or
* At $B500

I'm going to use $B500 since that keeps the "spirit" of $B500 "decoding"
Boot Stage 3 into $BE00. :-)


### Cracking in 3 Easy Payments, er Steps

These steps are quite detailed but should be rather straight-forward.
Just take your time and you'll do fine.

### Cracking Step 1: The Easy Stuff

If we want to keep the original code at $B500 (sentimental reasons, perhaps?)
we could stash this on the unused bytes on Track $15, Sector $5 @ $B580 -- but
we'd have to update the boot sector @ $087A:00 -> 80 to call our new mover:

From:

```asm
    879:20 00 B5
```

To:

```asm
    879:20 80 B5
```

Normally I like making the minimal number of changes possible
but let's keep the original code.

```asm
                    ORG $B580

                    Krack:
    B580:A2 00              LDX #$00                ; Copy 256 bytes/page, 2x Pages
                                                    ; We probably should also
                                                    ;     LDY #$00

Hold off entering this in for now, we'll queue this up in a minute.

### Cracking Step 2: The Tedious Stuff

Since I'm lazy I don't feel like manually entering in T15S6 ($BE00)
and T15S7 ($BF00).  Now we can't just do a manual sector copy off the
original Fantavision disk since Track $22 doesn't have any traditional sectors!

Instead, we'll want to save $BE00 .. $BFFF on our `Fanta.Work` disk -- but with
a twist.  Due to DOS 3.3 retarded _amateur design_ it stores 4 bytes IN the binary file.

What we want is the DOS 3.3 file such that $BE00 is aligned on the
_start_ of a sector -- that way we can manually copy the two sectors.
All we need do is save a dummy $100-4 = $FC prefix to force the alignment.

If you already have `B3.FANTAVISION_T22_BC00` skip to step 7.
Otherwise, if you missed saving Boot Stage 3 here is a quick way to save it:

1. Remove any disk in Slot 6, Drive 1
2. Insert Fantavision in Slot 6, Drive 1
3. Enter in these instructions:

```
    CALL-151
    9600<C600.C6FFM
    96FA:9F
    9F00:60 60
    9600G
    FC58G
    2B:60
    801G

    2000<B000.BFFFM
```

4. Replace disk in Slot 6, Drive 1, with `Fanta.Work`
5. `C600`
6. `BSAVE B3.FANTAVISION_T22_BC00,A$2C00,L$400`
    Optional skip 7 :-)
7. `BLOAD B3.FANTAVISION_T22_BC00,A$2C00`
8. `BSAVE B3.KRACK_T22_B600,A$2B04,L$4FC`

  Now move your `Fanta.Work` disk to Drive 2, and fire up Copy \]\[+ in Drive 1.

9. Now the hard part -- where was our $BC00 code saved on `Fanta.Work` ?
  *  `Track/Sector Map` > `Disk B`
  * Make a note of which file it is, i.e. `K`
  * `RETURN` to continue
  * `RETURN` to see the files allocated. On my disk it was saved at Track $F, Sector $F .. Sector $A
  * `RETURN` to return to the menu

10. `Sector Edit` > `Disk B`
11. Optional Read Track $11, Sector $F and/or Sector $E.
  * Look for our filename: `B3.KRACK_T22_B600`, and move back 3 bytes
12. `R` to read Track T1, Sector S1 for the FTOC. At address $12 is the Track/Sector we want
13. `R` to read Track T2, Sector S2. i.e. Track $0F, Sector $B
14. Remove `Fanta.Work`
15. Replace with `Fanta.COPYA`
16. `W` to Track $15, Sector $6

17. Remove `Fanta.COPYA`
18. Replace with `Fanta.Work`
19. `R` to read Track T2, Sector S2-1. i.e. Track $0F, Sector $A
20. Remove `Fanta.Work`
21. Replace with `Fanta.COPYA`
22. `W` to write Track $15, Sector $7

Here is a little table to help:

| Disk      | Read  | Write |
|:----------|:-----:|:-----:|
|Fanta.Work | T0FSB | n/a   |
|Fanta.COPYA| n/a   | T15S6 |
|Fanta.Work | T0FSA | n/a   |
|Fanta.COPYA| n/a   | T15S7 |

Don't forgot we need to modify T15S5 with our `mini $BE00 loader`

23. `R` to read Track $15, Sector $5
24. `H` to enter in the bytes from Step 1,

```asm
    B500:A2 00 BD 00 B6 9D 00 BE
    B508:BD 00 B7 9D 00 BF E8 D0
    B510:F1 18 60
```

25. `W` to write Track $15, Sector $5

26. Lastly, let's patch T00S0 to call our new mover.
  * `R` Track $00, Sector $0
  * `A` Address $7A
  * `H` Hex: $80
27. And `W` to write it.

Whew!  One more step.


### Cracking Step 3: Skip Nibble Count 2

The astute reader will notice this is titled "Skip Nibble Count 2".
What happened to Nibble Count 1? We already handled that in the
previous instructions.  Pay attention! :-)

Seriously though, we just have one more tiny patch to make:

The code at $BE00 calls nibble check 2 @ $BEAA

```
    BEAA:4C AD BE           JMP DoNibbleCheck2
                    DoNibbleCheck2:
    BEAD:A0 00              LDY #$00
```

This routine ends at $BF0F -- so let's jump there instead skipping the whole thing. :-)

1. `R` Track $15, Sector $6
2. `A` Address $AB
3. `H` Hex: $0F $BF
2. `W` Track $15, Sector $6

And now for the moment of truth ...

Put our `Fanta.COPYA` in Slot 6, Drive 1, and reboot.

* ![Main](pics/main.png)

/Oblg. _"I'm making a note here: HUGE SUCCESS."_

10 minutes of work, 10 hours to write all this crap up. :-)


## ProDOS Hybrid!?

If we boot `ProDOS` and try to `CAT` our `Fanta.COPYA` disk
our efforts are rewarded with this:

# In Search of a Better Beep, or two

Some of us Apple fans take our BEEP pretty serious.

# Cramming everything on side A?

So we have a TON of unused space now. How much of side B can we fit onto side A ?

TODO: Determine how many movies from Side B we can fit onto Side A ?


# An Alternate Time-Line

I'm not the only who wished history had turned out different. :-/

NO, I'm not talking about Hitler or some bad Sci-Fi Deus Ex Machina time travel cop-out.
See, [Godwin's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law)
automatically got invoked and we didn't even do anything!

Anyways, [another Fantavision Fan](https://68kmla.org/forums/index.php?/topic/5766-a-fictional-history-of-fantavision/)
wrote up this serious/funny lament of Fantavision history:

I always thought that this was a pretty neat vector animation program for the Apple II. What do you think would happen if it went on and was still around today instead of Flash? Here's what I think would come about:

* 1988: Fantavision 2.0 is released. With this version, many other 8 bit platforms, such as the C64, the ZX Spectrum, the Amstrad CPC, the Atari 8 bit line, the MSX, the Sharp X1, and the PC-8801 are supported, along with more 16 and 32 bit platforms such as the Macintosh and X68000. Changes include faster and more compact vector Algorithms, support for digitized sound, an interface overhaul with support for scenes, which can be assigned backdrops and objects for each, export to standalone, and limited support for raster graphics and text.

* 1990: Fantavision 3.0 Last version for 8 bit platforms. support for the Sharp X1 and MSX is dropped, and interactivity, along with the Fantascript scripting language, is added. Also, a unified Fantavision format, .FTV, is created to make exchange across platforms easier. Also, support for raster effects is added.

* 1992: Fantavision 4.0 Fantavision is acquired by Macromind. This is also the first version without 8 bit support. Platform support added: FM Towns computers, Atari Falcon 030, and the Amiga 1200. In this version, support for animated rasters and more raster effects is added, along with 3D object support.

* 1994: Fantavision 5.0 Last 16 bit version. In this version, support for 3D backdrops and cameras is added, along with 3D collision detection, and inverse kinematics for both 2D and 3D objects.

* 1996: Fantavision 6.0 Fantavision goes online! The new online player goes through several name changes before finally settling on Vectorshock. support for 3D textures and lighting, as well as video (soundless), 2D raster backgrounds, and panoramic 3D backgrounds. scrapped names for Fantavision web player:

- Fantavision Online
- Fantavision Live
- Fantavision Theater
- Livevision
- Liveweb
- Livetheater
- Futureshock
- Vectorvision
- Vectortheater
- Vectorsplash
- Vectorwave

* 1999: Fantavision 7.0 Support for networking, video with sound, and many more vector and raster effects is added. Macromedia decides to release the Fantavision player as open source.

* 2000: Fantavision 7.5 Fantavision now supports many more video formats, and very high quality video. The Fantavision file format is declared a standard by the ISO.

**sigh.**

Instead we got Flash dominating the Web (since HTML/Javascript sucked so bad)
and Steve Jobs ranting how [Flash sucks](http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/)
in 2010 until Flash _finally_ died ~2017.

> Apple has a long relationship with Adobe. In fact, we met Adobe‚Äôs founders when they were in their proverbial garage. Apple was their first big customer, adopting their Postscript language for our new Laserwriter printer. Apple invested in Adobe and owned around 20% of the company for many years. The two companies worked closely together to pioneer desktop publishing and there were many good times. Since that golden era, the companies have grown apart. Apple went through its near death experience, and Adobe was drawn to the corporate market with their Acrobat products. Today the two companies still work together to serve their joint creative customers ‚Äì Mac users buy around half of Adobe‚Äôs Creative Suite products ‚Äì but beyond that there are few joint interests.

> I wanted to jot down some of our thoughts on Adobe‚Äôs Flash products so that customers and critics may better understand why we do not allow Flash on iPhones, iPods and iPads. Adobe has characterized our decision as being primarily business driven ‚Äì they say we want to protect our App Store ‚Äì but in reality it is based on technology issues. Adobe claims that we are a closed system, and that Flash is open, but in fact the opposite is true. Let me explain.

> First, there‚Äôs ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù.

> Adobe‚Äôs Flash products are 100% proprietary. They are only available from Adobe, and Adobe has sole authority as to their future enhancement, pricing, etc. While Adobe‚Äôs Flash products are widely available, this does not mean they are open, since they are controlled entirely by Adobe and available only from Adobe. By almost any definition, Flash is a closed system.

> Apple has many proprietary products too. Though the operating system for the iPhone, iPod and iPad is proprietary, we strongly believe that all standards pertaining to the web should be open. Rather than use Flash, Apple has adopted HTML5, CSS and JavaScript ‚Äì all open standards. Apple‚Äôs mobile devices all ship with high performance, low power implementations of these open standards. HTML5, the new web standard that has been adopted by Apple, Google and many others, lets web developers create advanced graphics, typography, animations and transitions without relying on third party browser plug-ins (like Flash). HTML5 is completely open and controlled by a standards committee, of which Apple is a member.

> Apple even creates open standards for the web. For example, Apple began with a small open source project and created WebKit, a complete open-source HTML5 rendering engine that is the heart of the Safari web browser used in all our products. WebKit has been widely adopted. Google uses it for Android‚Äôs browser, Palm uses it, Nokia uses it, and RIM (Blackberry) has announced they will use it too. Almost every smartphone web browser other than Microsoft‚Äôs uses WebKit. By making its WebKit technology open, Apple has set the standard for mobile web browsers.

> Second, there‚Äôs the ‚Äúfull web‚Äù.

> Adobe has repeatedly said that Apple mobile devices cannot access ‚Äúthe full web‚Äù because 75% of video on the web is in Flash. What they don‚Äôt say is that almost all this video is also available in a more modern format, H.264, and viewable on iPhones, iPods and iPads. YouTube, with an estimated 40% of the web‚Äôs video, shines in an app bundled on all Apple mobile devices, with the iPad offering perhaps the best YouTube discovery and viewing experience ever. Add to this video from Vimeo, Netflix, Facebook, ABC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, ESPN, NPR, Time, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Sports Illustrated, People, National Geographic, and many, many others. iPhone, iPod and iPad users aren‚Äôt missing much video.

> Another Adobe claim is that Apple devices cannot play Flash games. This is true. Fortunately, there are over 50,000 games and entertainment titles on the App Store, and many of them are free. There are more games and entertainment titles available for iPhone, iPod and iPad than for any other platform in the world.

> Third, there‚Äôs reliability, security and performance.

> Symantec recently highlighted Flash for having one of the worst security records in 2009. We also know first hand that Flash is the number one reason Macs crash. We have been working with Adobe to fix these problems, but they have persisted for several years now. We don‚Äôt want to reduce the reliability and security of our iPhones, iPods and iPads by adding Flash.

> In addition, Flash has not performed well on mobile devices. We have routinely asked Adobe to show us Flash performing well on a mobile device, any mobile device, for a few years now. We have never seen it. Adobe publicly said that Flash would ship on a smartphone in early 2009, then the second half of 2009, then the first half of 2010, and now they say the second half of 2010. We think it will eventually ship, but we‚Äôre glad we didn‚Äôt hold our breath. Who knows how it will perform?

> Fourth, there‚Äôs battery life.

> To achieve long battery life when playing video, mobile devices must decode the video in hardware; decoding it in software uses too much power. Many of the chips used in modern mobile devices contain a decoder called H.264 ‚Äì an industry standard that is used in every Blu-ray DVD player and has been adopted by Apple, Google (YouTube), Vimeo, Netflix and many other companies.

> Although Flash has recently added support for H.264, the video on almost all Flash websites currently requires an older generation decoder that is not implemented in mobile chips and must be run in software. The difference is striking: on an iPhone, for example, H.264 videos play for up to 10 hours, while videos decoded in software play for less than 5 hours before the battery is fully drained.

> When websites re-encode their videos using H.264, they can offer them without using Flash at all. They play perfectly in browsers like Apple‚Äôs Safari and Google‚Äôs Chrome without any plugins whatsoever, and look great on iPhones, iPods and iPads.

> Fifth, there‚Äôs Touch.

> Flash was designed for PCs using mice, not for touch screens using fingers. For example, many Flash websites rely on ‚Äúrollovers‚Äù, which pop up menus or other elements when the mouse arrow hovers over a specific spot. Apple‚Äôs revolutionary multi-touch interface doesn‚Äôt use a mouse, and there is no concept of a rollover. Most Flash websites will need to be rewritten to support touch-based devices. If developers need to rewrite their Flash websites, why not use modern technologies like HTML5, CSS and JavaScript?

> Even if iPhones, iPods and iPads ran Flash, it would not solve the problem that most Flash websites need to be rewritten to support touch-based devices.

> Sixth, the most important reason.

> Besides the fact that Flash is closed and proprietary, has major technical drawbacks, and doesn‚Äôt support touch based devices, there is an even more important reason we do not allow Flash on iPhones, iPods and iPads. We have discussed the downsides of using Flash to play video and interactive content from websites, but Adobe also wants developers to adopt Flash to create apps that run on our mobile devices.

> We know from painful experience that letting a third party layer of software come between the platform and the developer ultimately results in sub-standard apps and hinders the enhancement and progress of the platform. If developers grow dependent on third party development libraries and tools, they can only take advantage of platform enhancements if and when the third party chooses to adopt the new features. We cannot be at the mercy of a third party deciding if and when they will make our enhancements available to our developers.

> This becomes even worse if the third party is supplying a cross platform development tool. The third party may not adopt enhancements from one platform unless they are available on all of their supported platforms. Hence developers only have access to the lowest common denominator set of features. Again, we cannot accept an outcome where developers are blocked from using our innovations and enhancements because they are not available on our competitor‚Äôs platforms.

> Flash is a cross platform development tool. It is not Adobe‚Äôs goal to help developers write the best iPhone, iPod and iPad apps. It is their goal to help developers write cross platform apps. And Adobe has been painfully slow to adopt enhancements to Apple‚Äôs platforms. For example, although Mac OS X has been shipping for almost 10 years now, Adobe just adopted it fully (Cocoa) two weeks ago when they shipped CS5. Adobe was the last major third party developer to fully adopt Mac OS X.

> Our motivation is simple ‚Äì we want to provide the most advanced and innovative platform to our developers, and we want them to stand directly on the shoulders of this platform and create the best apps the world has ever seen. We want to continually enhance the platform so developers can create even more amazing, powerful, fun and useful applications. Everyone wins ‚Äì we sell more devices because we have the best apps, developers reach a wider and wider audience and customer base, and users are continually delighted by the best and broadest selection of apps on any platform.

> Conclusions.

> Flash was created during the PC era ‚Äì for PCs and mice. Flash is a successful business for Adobe, and we can understand why they want to push it beyond PCs. But the mobile era is about low power devices, touch interfaces and open web standards ‚Äì all areas where Flash falls short.

> The avalanche of media outlets offering their content for Apple‚Äôs mobile devices demonstrates that Flash is no longer necessary to watch video or consume any kind of web content. And the 250,000 apps on Apple‚Äôs App Store proves that Flash isn‚Äôt necessary for tens of thousands of developers to create graphically rich applications, including games.

> New open standards created in the mobile era, such as HTML5, will win on mobile devices (and PCs too). Perhaps Adobe should focus more on creating great HTML5 tools for the future, and less on criticizing Apple for leaving the past behind.
